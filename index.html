				<h2>A co-founder at one of the world's largest communities.</h2>
				<p>The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500 companies has allowed me to develope a skillset
					that helps me in not just development, but in every aspect of any business.</p>
				<p>I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's largest communities teaching young minds
					about how to <em>sell</em> yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new world of opportunities.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>As a developer, you have everything available to you and all that;s holding you back is yourself.</p>
				<p>A quote I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean.</p>
				<p>"How big would you dream, if you <strong>knew</strong> you wouldn't fail?" You've already gone through the
					hardest parts being a developer, it's time to elevate your skills and become a leader in something you're
					passionate about.</p>
				<p>I'm happy to chat over coffee some times about how I can help your company.</p>
